Project Name: The Sequence Game

About Sequence Game: Our game concept is watch the sequence for few seconds, and player remembers that sequence, and then type the correct sequence with buttons in given short time.
The sequences will grow from 3 to 8.

When the Sequence game starts Not My head logo appears first, after that game loads in to Menu. In Menu we can see different options like Start, Options, Tutorial.

In Tutorial from the menu player can read the game plan and other details about the Sequence game.

By choosing the Start option in menu player can start the game.

If player type the correct sequence he/she can earn some coins and continue game with further sequences. 


If player enters correct sequence (ex: 421) two times, then your sequence will grow (1432) to play, after entering 4 sequences, that it will grow to 5 sequences (13243). Like that sequence will grow till 8(23413421) sequences.

After each correct sequence, player will earn some coins. By spending those coins can replay the sequence in the middle of the game and the player also can buy different layouts like directions, animals, emojiâ€™s from Options in Menu.

If player enters the wrong sequence, he/she will loose one life from the count of 5 lives. Player can continue the game with the remaining lives, till he/she looses all the lives.


When player starts the game next time, he/she can start game with 5 lives and the coins that he/she earned in previous game/games.
